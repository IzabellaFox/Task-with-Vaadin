This application was created for my participation in Promand 2014

Application consist of two listboxes with multiple column text inside. 
Buttons ">" and "<" moves selected items to right and left list boxes accordingly. 
"Checkout" button shows a popup with data in right listbox.
Using "Add" and "Remove" buttons user can add or delete items from listbox on the left
